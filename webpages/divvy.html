        is a public bike sharing service in Chicago operated by Lyft for the Chicago
        Department of Transportation. 
        Launched in 2013, Divvy bike share currently has 681 bike stations and 
        about 337 thousand monthly riderships (as in April 2021). Riders can 
        process bike rental in two ways: casual riders can rent out divvy bikes 
        from stations using a one-time check-out system installed in the station. 
        Members can rent out divvy bikes by scanning the QR code on each bike 
        from their Lyft app on their phone.

        Figure 1 shows the network graph of Divvy bike trips. 
        Each node represents a bike station, and the width of 
        every undirected edge between two nodes represents the 
        number of trips from one station to the other. We can clearly 
        see that bike stations vary widely by usage volume. 
        <strong>In this project, the usage volume of a divvy bike station is 
        defined as the sum between the number of station-to-station 
        divvy bike trips in April 2021 that started at the station 
        and those that ended at the station.</strong> Stations in downtown 
        and the northside of Chicago are more popular than those in other areas. 
        Though stations are well distributed at the westside and southside 
        of Chicago, Hyde Park is the only neighborhood in the southside of 
        Chicago with high Divvy bike usage volume in April 2021.

        Figure 2 shows the distribution of divvy bike stations by usage volume, 
        which ranges quite widely. Some stations were used only once in April 2021, 
        while the most popular station was used 7109 times. <strong>What factors affect 
        the variations in usage volume among divvy bike stations?</strong>
      </p>

      <p class="comment">
        To answer this question, this project formulates 6 groups of hypotheses on factors 
        that may potentially affect usage volume of divvy bike stations. 
        To test these hypotheses, the project compiled a station-level dataset 
        from a wide range of databases, including 
        <a href="https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data" target="_blank">Divvy historical trip records (April 2021)</a>, 
        <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org" target="_blank">the City of Chicago Data Portal</a>,
        <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/data/datasets.html" target="_blank">US Census (2010)</a>, and
        <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/data/" target="_blank">Zillow Research</a>. 
        <strong>Results show interesting associations between the usage volume of divvy bike 
        stations and factors including network effects, crime rates, socio-economic status, 
        and demography.</strong> The following blog post is composed of three sections:
        <ul class="comment">
          <li>Section one provides a brief descriptive overview of Divvy historic trip data (April 2021), 
            which is the primary dataset for this project. </li>
          <li>Section two introduces six groups of hypotheses and describes how relevant independent 
            variables are collected and measured. </li>
          <li>Section three discusses the results of hypothesis testing using multivariate OLS regression models.</li>

          stores information on every divvy

          time stamps. The April 2021 Divvy historic trip dataset records 337,230 trips in total, among 
          which 298,207 trips were from station to station. </p>

        <p class="comment">Figure 3 shows the distribution of Divvy bike trips by date in April. 
          We can see that the number of bike trips spiked during weekends 
          (highlighted in red boxes) and decreased on rainy days (highlighted in blue 
          boxes). Figure 4 shows the breakdown of bike trips by the hours of the day. 
          It is clear that Divvy bike usage peaked during the afternoon hours 
          (3pm to 7pm). In April 2021, 681 Divvy bike stations were used (to check 
          out or return a bike) at least once. Figure 5 shows the top 10 most 
          used Divvy Bike stations in April. As expected, all of them are located 
          in the downtown area and close to the lakeshore. </p>

      <h2 class='observations'>Hypotheses Group 1: location and purpose</h2>
      <p class="comment">It is likely that bike stations in certain locations mainly serve users 
        with a particular purpose. For example, bike stations located near tourist 
        attractions are mainly used for sightseeing. Stations along a long bike 
        trail are used for exercising. Stations in residential areas are used for 
        commuting. These locations and user objectives may impact the volume of 
        station usage. Tourist sites are likely to attract more bike traffic than 
        residential areas or long bike trails. Here are the hypotheses:
        <ul class="comment">
          <li>H1a: Stations with a high proportion of riders who pay one-time fees, 
            which signal proximity to tourist sites, are positively associated with 
            usage volume. </li>
          <li>H1b: Stations with high average trip distances, which signal proximity 
            to long bike trails, are associated with low usage volume.  </li>
          <li>H1c: Stations with a high proportion of morning or weekday usage, 
            which signal proximity to residential areas, are negatively associated 
            with usage volume.</li>

        Table P1 lists the variables collected to test these hypotheses. 
        In the station-level dataset compiled from 
        <a href="https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data" target="_blank">Divvy historical trip data</a>, 
        every row represents a unique divvy bike station that was used at least 
        once in station-to-station trips in April 2021. ‘Total_count’ is the outcome 
        variable, which measures a station’s usage volume. Predictor variables include 
        payment process (‘casual_p’), distance (‘average_distance’) and usage time 
        period (‘weekday_p’, ‘morning_p’, ‘evening_p’). Figure P1 shows the distribution 
        of stations by these variables.

      <p class="comment">It is likely that bike stations located in places with high crime 
        rates were used less frequently than those in low crime rate areas. 
        The project collected 
        <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2020/qzdf-xmn8" target="_blank">the Chicago Crime record data in 2020</a> 
        from the City of 
        Chicago data portal. Figure P2a shows the top 10 crime categories by the number 
        of cases in Chicago (2020).  Notice that except for ‘deceptive practice’, the 
        other nine categories all involve physical violence that mostly took place in 
        public streets. In contrast, deceptive practices, which include identity theft 
        and financial fraud, represent white collar crimes that mostly take place in 
        downtown office buildings. Therefore, I separately measure the number of these 
        two types of crime in 2020 that were committed in locations near each bike 
        station. I hypothesize that:
        <ul class="comment">

      <p class="comment">The project assumes that the local divvy bike station density and 
        population density represent the supply and demand of each bike station. 
        Having a large supply of bike stations means that each bike station is used

        is used more often. Here are the hypotheses:

      <h2 class='observations'>Hypotheses Group 4: other public transportations</h2>
      <p class="comment">Chicago has 144 CTA rail stations (as of December 2018) and 10847 
        bus stops (as of November 2020). These alternative public transportation 
        facilities may have complex associations with bike stations’ usage volume. 
        After controlling for population density, I suspect that there are two conflicting 
        effects: (1) substitution effect. It is likely that bus, rail, and public bike 
        shares serve similar purposes and compete with each other for passengers. 
        Therefore, having many bus stops or rail stations nearby reduces the popularity 
        of a bike station. (2) Complement effect. It is likely that public bike shares 
        are used for shorter distance travel than bus or rail systems. Therefore, 
        passengers may use bike share service often before or after commuting by bus 
        or rail. For this reason, having many bus stops nearby or close to rail stations 
        may increase the popularity of the bike stations. I hypothesize that the 
        complement effect plays a strong role: 
        <ul class="comment">
          <li>H4: A large number of nearby bus stops or close proximity to a rail 
            station is associated with a high usage volume of the divvy bike station. </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p class="comment">
        Table P4 lists the two variables of interest. “min_dis_rail_station” measures the 
        euclidean distance between the bike station and the nearest CTA rail station. 
        “num_bus_stop” counts the number of bus stops within 0.002 degrees (200m) in 
        both the longitude and latitude from the bike station. Both CTA 
        <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-L-Rail-Stations-kml/4qtv-9w43" target="_blank">rail stations</a> and 
        <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-Bus-Stops-kml/84eu-buny" target="_blank">bus stops</a>  
        data were collected from the City of Chicago Data Portal. Figure P4 shows the 
        distribution of stations by these two variables.

      <h2 class='observations'>Hypotheses Group 5: socio-economic status</h2>
      <p class="comment">This project suspects that the divvy bike share service is mainly 
        used by the middle class. It is because the residents in disadvantaged 
        neighborhoods may not feel comfortable paying for public bike rides. Meanwhile, 
        the wealthy upper-class population may prefer their own personal bikes or 
        vehicles rather than public bikes. Therefore, I hypothesize an inverse “U” 
        shaped curve for the relationship between socio-economic status and usage volume:
        <ul class="comment">
          <li>H5: As the average home value of a neighborhood increases, the usage 
            volume of bike stations in the neighborhood first increases, then decreases. </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

        home value of the zipcode where bike stations are located. The variable is 
        collected from 
        <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/data/" target="_blank">Zillow Housing data</a>

  <p class="comment">Table P7 shows the summary table of all variables. 
    Figure P7 shows the correlation heatmap. Here are a few observations from the heatmap: 
    (1) the number of bike stations nearby is highly correlated with the 
    number of white collar crimes nearby. It suggests that places with 
    high numbers in both categories are likely to be downtown Chicago. 
    These two variables are positively correlated with the outcome variable 
    (total_count). (2) the proportion of the white population is highly 
    correlated with the proportion of young people (age 18-39) in an area. 
    These variables are also positively correlated with the outcome variable.</p>

  <p class="title2">Results</p>

  <p class="comment">To ensure interpretability, the project employs multivariate 
    OLS regression models to test the hypotheses. Because the distributions of 
    most variables are highly skewed, log transformation is applied on all variables 
    for consistent interpretation, including the outcome variable. Table P8 shows 
    the results of the two regression models. Model (1) contains all variables 
    discussed in the six hypotheses. Model (2) represents the final model that 
    only includes variables with statistically significant associations (p &#60; 0.1) 
    to the outcome. Both models have adjusted R-squared values of about 0.75, which 
    means that the predictor variables in the models explained about 75% of the 
    variations in divvy bike station volume usage.</p>

        <p class="comment">The result from model (1) provides no support for hypothesis H1a. 
          It provides support for H1b, and suggests an opposite effect for H1c. </p>

          <p class="comment">
          The coefficient for log(casual_p) is not statistically significant (p&#62;0.1). It means
          that <strong>the results cannot identify clear associations between proportion of casual riders
          and station usage volume, controlling for other factors</strong>. 
          There are three possible explanations: (a) high one-time payment percentage does not 
          suggest that the station is located at tourist attractions, (b) locating at tourist 
          sites does not lead to high volume of bike usage, (c) because the data is recorded 
          during the covid-19 pandemic (April 2021), tourist sites did not attract as much 
          visitors as pre-pandemic times.
        </p>
  
        <p class="comment">
          The coefficient for log(average_distance) is -0.24 and statistically significant (p&#60;0.01). 
          It means that, <strong>controlling for other factors, a 1 percent increase in the average 
          distance of trips that use the station (in the divvy bike station distribution) is 
          associated with a 0.24% reduction in station usage volume</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="comment">
          <strong>Controlling for other factors, a 1 percent increase in weekday usage (in the divvy bike 
          station distribution) is associated with a 0.35% increase in station usage volume, 
          and a 1 percent increase in morning usage (in the divvy bike station distribution) 
          is associated with a 0.17% increase in station usage volume (p&#60;0.01)</strong>. These 
          results suggest an opposite effect from what we hypothesized in H1c. A possible 
          explanation is that stations mainly used for commute or daily errands are associated 
          with a higher volume of usage.
        </p>


        <p class="comment">
          Furthermore, <strong>a one percent increase in the evening (9pm to 6am) usage 
          (in the divvy bike station distribution) is linked with a 0.08% increase in station 
          usage volume (p&#60;0.01)</strong>. It may be because stations that are used often in the 
          evening are located in areas with good lighting, most likely in geographically 
          important locations.

          Results in model (1) provide support for H3b and suggest an opposite effect to H3a. 
          <strong>Controlling for other factors, a one percent increase in population density of 
          the zipcode in which the station is located is linked to a 0.36% increase in bike 
          station volume (p&#60;0.01). Meanwhile, a one percent increase in the number of 
          other divvy bike stations nearby is also associated with a 0.04% increase in bike 
          station volume (p&#60;0.1).</strong> Network effect may be an explanation for the positive 
          link between the number of other divvy bike stations nearby and bike station 
          volume: having more bike stations nearby makes it more convenient for riders to 
          use divvy bikes for short distance trips. The network effect also explains H1b, 
          where stations with high average trips, which signals that they are far away from 
          other stations (absence of network effect), are associated with low usage volume.

          Results in the model (1) do not support H4a. <strong>Controlling for other factors, including 
          population density, having rail stations or bus stops nearby are not linked to the 
          popularity of bike stations (p&#62;0.1)</strong>. It may be because the complement and

          Results in model (1) show an opposite effect from H5. H5 expects an inverse U 
          shape curve, which suggests that the stations in the middle class zip code 
          areas are used more often than stations in wealthy or disadvantaged zip code 
          areas. To my astonishment, <strong>the result suggests a U shape curve instead: as 
          the average home value in a zip code area increases, the usage volume of bike 
          stations first decreases, then increases (p&#60;0.05) (see Figure P8)</strong>. 
          So far, I am unable to come up with a convincing explanation.

          Results in model (1) support both H6a and H6b. <strong>The preference of using public 
          bike share varies by racial composition of the area.</strong> Controlling for other

          <strong>Having a greater proportion of young people in an area also increases public

          the proportion of population between 18 and 29 in the zip code area where 
          the bike station is located (in the divvy bike station distribution) is
