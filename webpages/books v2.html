          "Not all customers are a good fit for your product. Instead of trying to attract everyone, a more efficient marketing strategy is to: 
(1) identify your current high-value customer segments by life-time value. 
(2) understand why your product satisfies the needs of these customer segments better than your competitors' product can. 
(3) Measure these customer segments' total market size and your current market share. 
(4) If there's high potential for growth, set the goal of ""growing the market share in these high-value customer segments"" as your top strategic priority. Concentrate your marketing budget and tailor personalized marketing campaigns to attract and retain these customer segments.
(5) Grow and nurture your relationship with your high value customer segments by improving your product and services to better serve the needs of these customer segments.
(6) Only after you became the clear market leader of these customer segments and see a saturation in growth, consider expanding to other customer segments."
