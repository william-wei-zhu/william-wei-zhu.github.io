          <strong>Abstract:</strong> This study explores the use of state data 
          sets and meta-analysis of 
          low-powered studies to evaluate a school-based dropout prevention 
          program for students with disabilities. The program was implemented 
          in several states. A randomized controlled trial was infeasible 
          because schools were not chosen at random; furthermore, pretest 
          data were minimal. The use of extant state data allowed these 
          obstacles to be overcome by providing valid pre- and post-intervention 
          outcomes as well as a large selection of schools and variables to 
          create reasonable matches for the treatment schools. Results from 
          four states were synthesized meta-analytically to evaluate whether 
          the program had a significant impact on any of seven proximal and 
          distal outcome variables. No such impacts were demonstrated. More 
          importantly, this paper demonstrates and explains the methodological 
          steps and choices involved in a quasi-experimental evaluation 
          approach that may be applied to cases for which large amounts of 
          extant data are available.</p>

        A Preliminary Study of Leadership Montgomery’s Racial Equity Action Leadership Program

        <strong>Executive Summary:</strong> 
        Understanding the importance of equity within
        organizations, Leadership Montgomery (LM) created
        the Racial Equity Action Leadership (REAL) program
        in 2019. Recognizing the importance of this effort,
        LM contracted with Westat to design and implement
        a strategic study of the REAL program with the
        goal of sharing overarching outcomes of year 1 for
        the program, including identifying key takeaways.
        One overarching research question, how has the
        REAL program played a role in shaping racial equity
        mindsets, guided the study of the program. Critical
        race theory (CRT) was the most relevant conceptual
        framework chosen for the study because CRT places
        a problem in social, political, and historical contexts
        while considering issues of privilege, racism, and
        other forms of oppression. Drawing on both
        quantitative and qualitative methods, the study
        team conducted surveys, collected narratives, and
        embedded a participant observer for the entirety
        of the course. Additionally, individuals from one
        organization were case study participants with
        whom the study team conducted focus groups.
        Overall, race and racism and the knowledge and
        skills needed to implement change were foremost
        for the cohort. Understanding one’s own identity
        and increased knowledge to foster communication 
        in the workplace were tools the cohort found useful.
        Next steps for the cohort include implementation of
        skills and tools provided with the understanding that
        effective change will take time, but the journey has
        begun.</p>

        The Skew of Pathways: The Structural Explanation for the 
        Asian American Academic Achievements
        </p>

        <strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper develops a structural explanation for why 1.5 and second generation
        Asian Americans on average have higher academic achievement than white Americans in the United States.
        The paper hypothesizes two pathways to upward mobility in the American job mobility structure: developing
        interpersonal skills to obtain managerial occupations and developing technical skills to obtain
        technical occupations. From Asian immigrant parents' perspective, the first pathway is less accessible due to cultural 
        disadvantages in the white American social environment. Meanwhile, the second pathway 
        is more accessible because of insignificant disadvantages in the white American academic 
        environment (especially in the STEM fields). To maximize their children’s likelihood of obtaining 
        upward mobility, Asian immigrant parents encourage their children to prioritize time and energy toward the second pathway. 
        Consequently, 1.5 and 2nd generation Asian 
        Americans have higher academic achievements but lower likelihood to obtain upper-managerial positions 
        than white Americans. This paper suggests that to reduce racial disparities in academic achievements, 
        education and industry organizations should foster "cultural-inclusive environments".
